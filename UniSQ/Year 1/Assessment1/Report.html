                My decisions for the design of this website was inspired by the requirement to create a neat and well-organized website. 
                I chose to center all text and images to give the overall site a consisent, and neat, easy to read appearance. 
                I decided to bold main headings and topics so that the pages were easy to read and easy to locate the information or highlight key information. 
                I was mindful in the colors of text that I chose to use and included alt descriptions in all images. 
                I also made use of 'strong' instead of simply using 'b'.
                These three decisions were made in order to provide usability for the visually impaired. 
                I placed the navigation to other website pages in the same location consistently in order to make it easier for visually impared but also
                so that there was consistency throughout the website. I aimed to keep the website simple and to the point, 
                yet effective with providing necessary information.
                I have implemented the margin attribute so that the margins can be automatically aligned on any device.

                One issue that I faced when designing the website was making the menu selection on the home page larger in size. 
                I had issues getting the menu items smaller than the website name and menu header, but larger than the size that it ended up being.
                I would have liked it to be larger to aide the visually impaired, but I did not want it to take attention away from the website name.
                Another issue that I experienced was that the CSS content would not always update on my web page and I could not figure out why this was.
                For example, I changed the styling of my H1 and H2 headings, but they do not change consistently in my webpage.

            <p>
                I believe that my design should be chosen because it is easy to read and navigate and is equipped with key information that descibes the department
                and its partner companies and their eco-friendly products.
